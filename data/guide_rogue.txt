[T]This mode is more challenging in multiplayer with more than 4 players. Although the match is limited to 8 players, large amount of enemies makes it difficult for players to gain an advantage. Additional strategies are required to cope with these challenges.[/T]

[H] RULE & GAMEPLAY CHANGES [/H]
[T]This mode is mainly inherited from the standard mode, though some mechanics have been modified.[/T]
[T]Players automatically engage in combat when they get close to enemies, but as long as the distance is no more than 2.65 tiles, combat won't be triggered. So you can avoid enemy combinations that you can't handle.[/T]
[T]After each round, the next turn will no longer belong to the next player in current gambler queue, but will instead be at the head of queue (left). The position of characters in the queue is not randomly distributed; it is determined by the character’s "initiative" attribute, with higher values placed closer to the front.[/T]
[T]Gamblers can join an ongoing match mid-game. Most enemies will have a one-turn delay upon min-joining, and players are not affected. Each level can have a maximum of 3 ongoing matches.[/T]
[T]Additionally, there are changes to initial items, starting health, and other aspects.[/T]

[H] CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES [/H]
[h]Initiative[/h][T]: Determines your priority in a match. Among characters of the same initiative level, players always have a higher priority than enemy. Among enemy, the priority is determined by vanilla's action priority.[/T]
[h]Luck[/h][T]: Increases the chance of triggering lucky by 30% per level. This applies to gun attacks, being attacked by guns, and item drops. If a trigger is successful, things will go in your favor.[/T]
