--- Lets this entity be attacked. Each flag appearing in `attackable.currentFlags`
--- makes this entity vulnerable to attacks checking for that flag.
--- @class Component.attackable
--- @field currentFlags integer # `= 0` Computed field. Do not modify directly, use an `objectUpdateAttackability` handler instead.
--- @field flags Attack.Flag, attack.mask(attack.Flag.CHARACTER # `= attack.Flag.DEFAULT)` 

--- Marks this entity as part of a team, making it friendly to entities in the same team.

--- @class Component.killCreditRequireHostileAttacker
--- @field removeFlags Kill.Credit # `= kill.CREDIT_ALL`

--- @field damage integer # `= 4` 

--- Prevents this entity from dealing explosive damage to entities in the same team.
--- @class Component.explosiveSafe

--- Makes this entity move after attacking.
--- @class Component.moveOnAttack
--- @field moveType Move.Flag, move.Flag.unmask(move.Type.UNCHECKED # `= move.Flag.INHIBIT_FROZEN)` This must not include move.Flag.HANDLE_ATTACK, or it would cause infinite recursion.

--- When this entity attacks, sets the victimâ€™s gold to 0.
--- @class Component.stealGoldOnAttack

--- @class Component.innateAttackInhibitAgainstNonTarget

--- Lets this entity be knocked back by attacks.
--- @class Component.knockbackable
--- @field minimumDistance integer # `= 0` If this is greater than 0, forces any hit on this entity to knock it back.
--- @field beatDelay integer # `= 1` When this entity takes knockback, its beat delay increases by this much.
--- @field moveType Move.Flag # `= move.Type.KNOCKBACK` 

--- When this entity takes knockback, sets it beat delay equal to `knockbackable.beatDelay`
--- (instead of increasing it by that much).
--- @class Component.knockbackableResetBeatDelay

--- Prevents this entity from being moved by knockback. It still suffers the other effects of knockback.
